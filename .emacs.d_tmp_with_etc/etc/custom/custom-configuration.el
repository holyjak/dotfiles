;; I'm sorry, Emacs Live failed to start correctly.
;; Hopefully the issue will be simple to resolve.
;;
;; First up, could you try running Emacs Live in safe mode:
;;
;;    emacs --live-safe-mode
;;
;; This will only load the default packs. If the error no longer occurs
;; then the problem is probably in a pack that you are loading yourself.
;; If the problem still exists, it may be a bug in Emacs Live itself.
;;
;; In either case, you should try starting Emacs in debug mode to get
;; more information regarding the error:
;;
;;    emacs --debug-init
;;
;; Please feel free to raise an issue on the Gihub tracker:
;;
;;    https://github.com/overtone/emacs-live/issues
;;
;; Alternatively, let us know in the mailing list:
;;
;;    http://groups.google.com/group/emacs-live
;;
;; Good luck, and thanks for using Emacs Live!
